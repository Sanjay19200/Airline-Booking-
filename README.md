# Airline-Booking-
Created an intuitive interface for users to specify travel details (from, to, date). Retrieved and processed flight data from external sources or manually updated datasets. Designed and implemented a database schema to store flight information, user bookings, and other relevant data. Connected the application to the database using appropriate connection settings and queries. Wrote efficient SQL queries to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.
